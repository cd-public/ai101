It announced up front that it was a 13-year old Ukrainian boy, which would explain the lack of knowledge and some discrepancies in the text. The bot convinced 30% of the judges that it was human after a 5 minute dialogue, a metric that Turing believed a machine would be able to pass by 2000. However, one should understand that this does not indicate that we have created an intelligent system, or that a computer system has fooled the human interrogator - the system didn’t fool the humans, but rather the bot creators did!\n\n✅ Have you ever been fooled by a chat bot into thinking that you are speaking to a human?

Cheat!\n\n\nA chat-bot called Eugene Goostman, developed in St. Petersburg, came close to passing the Turing test in 2014 by using a clever personality trick. It announced up front that it was a 13-year old Ukrainian boy, which would explain the lack of knowledge and some discrepancies in the text. The bot convinced 30% of the judges that it was human after a 5 minute dialogue, a metric that Turing believed a machine would be able to pass by 2000. However, one should understand that this does not indicate that we have created an intelligent system, or that a computer system has fooled the human interrogator - the system didn’t fool the humans, but rather the bot creators did!\n\n✅ Have you ever been fooled by a chat bot into thinking that you are speaking to a human? How did it convince you?"

Saygin (2000)1 visualizes the game as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteIdentity in the Architecture\n\n\n\nIt would be irresponsible not to remark that Turing, a queer scientist, used the formulation of gender to motivate the definition of machine intelligence. That is, the very identity for which Turing was persecuted (and likely assassinated) was critical to his insights that, among other things, won the Western Theatre for the Allies.\n\n\nTuring continued:\n\nWe now ask the question, “What will happen when a machine takes the part of A in this game?” Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace our original, “Can machines think?”\n\nSaygin (2000)2 visualizes this variant as follows:\n\n\n\nAn astute learning at this juncture will realize that a group of 3 humans is sufficient to administer this intelligence test to a modern “AI” chatbot, such as Google Gemini, a component of the Google Workspace provided by this university to all humans.
