## Motivating Questions

1. What is difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?
2. What are supervised and unsupervised learning used for?
3. What are some challenges with supervised and unsupervised learning?

## Supervised Learning

* Uses *labeled* data.
* Maps inputs to outputs.
* Goal: Predict outcomes.
* Examples: Classification, regression.

## Unsupervised Learning

* Uses *unlabeled* data.
* Finds hidden patterns.
* Goal: Discover structure.
* Examples: Clustering, dimensionality reduction.

## The Label Divide

* Supervised: Labeled data.
* Unsupervised: Unlabeled data.
* Label presence is key.

## Uses of Unsupervised


* Clustering: Grouping similar data.
  * E.g. discover Yemenia novel coffee varietal
  * [Learn more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oiHm0wlhfM)
    * 18 min + can't watch on stream.
* Anomaly detection: Finding outliers.
* Dimensionality reduction: Simplifying data.
* Association rule learning: Finding relationships.



## Clustering in Action

* Customer/market segmentation.
  * Why EU entered "esports winter" 18+ months before US?
* Document clustering.

## Anomaly Detection

* Detect fraudulent bank transactions.
  * E.g. if I purchased an espresso in Salem, MA
* Detect anomalous (computer) network behavior.
  * My colleague at MS does this
* Predict imminent equipment failure in e.g. manufacturing sector.
  * Do you do this in 596?

# Challenges

## Challenges 

- Evaluation
  * No clear "right" answer.
    * And sometimes there's *someday* a right answer, but you have to make the model now.
    * Sometimes the "right" answer is determined by someone in power.
  * Subjective evaluation metrics.
    * Non-falsifiable by construction.
  * Validating discovered patterns.



## Challenges

- Interpretation
  * Understanding discovered structures.
    * Think in e.g. practice midterm - did you "discover" colleges vs. universities.
    * What about "big school" and "small school"
  * Meaningful insights can be hard.
    * Did you find "Colleges that Change Lives"
  * Requires or at least benefits from domain expertise.

## Challenges

- Computational Cost
  * Large datasets are common.
  * Algorithms can be complex.
  * Scalability is a concern.
- [Computational costs become operating costs](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing/013EFE-0A54F4-1CB6BE/reports/cost-breakdown;timeRange=CUSTOM_RANGE;from=2024-06-01;to=2025-02-28?organizationId=692811010335&project=dataproc-ce-project)

## Takeaways

* Supervised: Labeled data &rArr; predict label.
* Unsupervised: Unlabeled data &rArr; discover patterns.
  * Valuable, but challenging.
  * Value is correlated with challenge given scarcity.
  
# Supervised vs Unsupervised vs Reinforcement Learning

Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention. The three primary types of ML are:

* **Supervised Learning:** Learning from labeled data.
* **Unsupervised Learning:** Discovering patterns in unlabeled data.
* **Reinforcement Learning:** Learning through interactions with an environment.

---

### 1. Supervised Learning
The model is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning each input has a corresponding output.
* **Labeled Data:** Training data has predefined labels.
* **Types of Problems:** Used for classification (e.g., spam detection) and regression (e.g., predicting house prices).
* **Algorithms:** Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, Neural Networks.

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
The model identifies patterns, clusters, or associations independently without predefined labels.
* **Unlabeled Data:** No predefined outputs.
* **Types of Problems:** Used for clustering (e.g., customer segmentation) and association (e.g., market basket analysis).
* **Algorithms:** K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, PCA, Autoencoders.

### 3. Reinforcement Learning (RL)
Involves an agent that interacts with an environment, learning through rewards and penalties to maximize long-term success.
* **Interaction-Based Learning:** The agent learns by taking actions and receiving feedback.
* **No Labeled Data:** Learns from trial and error.
* **Algorithms:** Q-learning, SARSA, Deep Q-Networks (DQN).
