## Announcements

- Lab Day
    - Set up a way to document our work this term.
    - Play out the Turing Test, or more properly, the "Imitation Game"

## Requirements

- [ ] Create a Google Drive folder for this course.
- [ ] Form a group of 3.    

# The Imitation Game

> It is not difficult to devise a paper machine which will play a not very bad game of chess. Now get three men A, B and C as subjects for the experiment. A and C are to be rather poor chess players, B is the operator who works the paper machine. ... Two rooms are used with some arrangement for communicating moves, and a game is played between C and either A or the paper machine. C may find it quite difficult to tell which he is playing.

- Turing (1948)

## "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" (1950)

Turing's primary work on intelligence was released in 1950, and began a simple statement:

>  "I propose to consider the question 'Can machines think?'"

Turing used the motivating example of the *imitation game*, a party game "in which a man and a woman go into separate rooms and guests try to tell them apart by writing a series of questions and reading the typewritten answers sent back". Saygin (2000)[^1] visualizes the game as follows:

## Identity in the Architecture

It would be irresponsible not to remark that Turing, a queer scientist, used the formulation of gender to motivate the definition of machine intelligence. That is, the very identity for which Turing was persecuted (and likely assassinated) was critical to his insights that, among other things, won the Western Theatre for the Allies.

:::

Turing continued:

> We now ask the question, "What will happen when a machine takes the part of A in this game?" Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace our original, "Can machines think?"

Saygin (2000)[^1]  visualizes this variant as follows:

An astute learning at this juncture will realize that a group of 3 students is sufficient to administer this intelligence test to a modern "AI" chatbot, such as Google Gemini, a component of the Google Workspace provided by this university to all students. You will additional need some way to pass type-written notes, for which I propose Google Documents.

# Course Setup

## Folder Setup

- Create a new folder in Google Drive for this class.
    - Your Google Drive is most likely located at the following address: [https://drive.google.com/](https://drive.google.com/)
        - You can read more here:  [Organize your files in Google Drive](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2375091)
    - Create a folder named "AI_<your school email>". For example, mine is "AI_ckdeutschbein"
        - I will refer to this as "your AI folder" 
    - Share this folder with [ckdeutschbein@willamette.edu](ckdeutschbein@willamette.edu)
        - You can read more here:  [Share folders in Google Drive](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/7166529)
        
## File Setup

- Create a new Document within the AI folder within which to "pass typewritten notes". 
    - In a group of three, I recommend nominating one student to create a file within their AI folder and share it with two other students.
- Name this file "Turing_Test"
- Determine some scheme to different players A, B, and C.
    - I recommend assigning each a color - such as <span style="color:red">red</span>, <span style="color:green">green</span> and <span style="color:blue">blue</span>.
    - I recommend agreeing to always start on a new line.
    - I recommend always ending a line by clarifying who should speak next.
        - For example, the interrogator may address questions to either two other players, but players may only reply to the interrogator.
    - This is your assignment for today, so take some effort to ensure it is clear and reproducible!
        - We are doing science after all!
- Create a separate, personal file that is not shared named "Prompt", which we will use latter.
        
## Gemini Setup

- At some point, each group member will play the part of the AI, so each will need access to some AI instance.
- You can most likely access Google Gemini at the following address: [https://gemini.google.com/](https://gemini.google.com/). 
- You will need to somehow prepare Gemini to play a specific part in the game.
    - We term this *prompting*.
    - It will be a component of the experimental design.

## Gemini

You can most likely access Google Gemini at the following address: [https://gemini.google.com/](https://gemini.google.com/). You may need to sign in to your official school account.
