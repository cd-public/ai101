<h2>Different Approaches to AI</h2>
<p>If we want a computer to behave like a human, we need somehow to model inside a computer our way of thinking. Consequently, we need to try to understand what makes a human being intelligent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To be able to program intelligence into a machine, we need to understand how our own processes of making decisions work. If you do a little self-introspection, you will realize that there are some processes that happen subconsciously – eg. we can distinguish a cat from a dog without thinking about it - while some others involve reasoning.</p>

<h2>Different Approaches to AI</h2>
<p>There are also some other possible approaches to intelligence:</p>
<ul>
<li>An <strong>Emergent</strong>, <strong>Synergetic</strong> or <strong>multi-agent approach</strong> are based on the fact that complex intelligent behaviour can be obtained by an interaction of a large number of simple agents. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_brain#Evolutionary_cybernetics">evolutionary cybernetics</a>, intelligence can <em>emerge</em> from more simple, reactive behaviour in the process of <em>metasystem transition</em>.</li>
<li>An <strong>Evolutionary approach</strong>, or <strong>genetic algorithm</strong> is an optimization process based on the principles of evolution.</li>

<h2>The Top-Down Approach</h2>
<ul>
<li>In a <strong>top-down approach</strong>, we try to model our reasoning.<br>
</li>
<li>Because we can follow our thoughts when we reason, we can try to formalize this process and program it inside the computer.</li>
<li>This is called <strong>symbolic reasoning</strong>, one example is grade-school <em>algebra</em></li>

<h2>The Top-Down Approach</h2>
<ul>
<li>People tend to have some rules in their head that guide their decision making processes.
<ul>
<li>At least according to them (go observe rush hour drivers for example)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For example, when a doctor is diagnosing a patient, they may realize that a person has a fever, and thus there might be some inflammation going on inside the body.</li>
<li>By applying a large set of rules to a specific problem a doctor may be able to come up with the final diagnosis.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="the-top-down-approach-2" class="slide level2">
<h2>The Top-Down Approach</h2>
<ul>
<li>This approach relies heavily on <strong>knowledge representation</strong> and <strong>reasoning</strong>.</li>
<li>Extracting knowledge from a human expert might be the most difficult part, because a doctor in many cases would not know exactly why they are coming up with a particular diagnosis.</li>
<li>Sometimes the solution just comes up in their head without explicit thinking.</li>
<li>Some tasks, such as determining the age of a person from a photograph, cannot be reduced to manipulating knowledge.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="bottom-up-approach" class="slide level2">
<h2>Bottom-Up Approach</h2>
<ul>
<li>Alternately, we can try to model the simplest <em>atomic</em> elements inside our brain – a neuron.
<ul>
<li>Obviously there are simpler elements (e.g.&nbsp;chemicals) but they take on different meaning in when not considered in isolation.</li>
<li>Therefore they are not <em>atomic</em>, or indivisible units of “brain”.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="bottom-up-approach-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Bottom-Up Approach</h2>
<ul>
<li>We can construct a so-called <strong>artificial neural network</strong> inside a computer, and then try to teach it to solve problems by giving it examples.
<ul>
<li>Allegedly this process is similar to how a newborn child learns about their surroundings by making observations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Simply program a computer to pretend to be however we think brains work.
<ul>
<li>Of note, in some sense it doesn’t matter if we model the brain correctly or not.</li>

<section id="a-brief-history-of-ai" class="slide level2">
<h2>A Brief History of AI</h2>
<ul>
<li>Artificial Intelligence was started as a field in the middle of the twentieth century.</li>
<li>Initially, symbolic reasoning was a prevalent approach, and it led to a number of important successes, such as expert systems – computer programs that were able to act as an expert in some limited problem domains.</li>
<li>However, it soon became clear that such approach does not scale well.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="problems-arise" class="slide level2">
<h2>Problems arise</h2>
<ul>
<li>Extracting the knowledge from an expert, representing it in a computer, and keeping that knowledgebase accurate turns out to be a very complex task, and too expensive to be practical in many cases.</li>
<li>This led to so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter">AI Winter</a> in the 1970s.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Computers Emerge</h2>
<ul>
<li>As time passed…
<ul>
<li>Computing resources became cheaper, and</li>
<li>More data has become available…</li>
</ul></li>
<li>So neural network approaches started demonstrating great performance in competing with human beings in many areas, such as computer vision or speech understanding.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>In the last decade, the term Artificial Intelligence has been mostly used as a synonym for Neural Networks, because most of the AI successes that we hear about are based on them.</em></p>

<section id="chess" class="slide level2">
<h2>Chess</h2>
<p>We can observe how the approaches changed, for example, in creating a chess playing computer program:</p>
<ul>
<li>Early chess programs were based on search – a program explicitly tried to estimate possible moves of an opponent for a given number of next moves, and selected an optimal move based on the optimal position that can be achieved in a few moves. It led to the development of the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning">alpha-beta pruning</a> search algorithm.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="chess-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Chess</h2>
<p>We can observe how the approaches changed, for example, in creating a chess playing computer program:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search strategies work well toward the end of the game, where the search space is limited by a small number of possible moves. However, at the beginning of the game, the search space is huge, and the algorithm can be improved by learning from existing matches between human players.</li>
<li>Subsequent experiments employed so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case-based_reasoning">case-based reasoning</a>, where the program looked for cases in the knowledge base very similar to the current position in the game.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="chess-2" class="slide level2">
<h2>Chess</h2>
<p>We can observe how the approaches changed, for example, in creating a chess playing computer program:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modern programs that win over human players are based on neural networks and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning">reinforcement learning</a>, where the programs learn to play solely by playing a long time against themselves and learning from their own mistakes – much like human beings do when learning to play chess.</li>
<li>However, a computer program can play many more games in much less time, and thus can learn much faster.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="chatbots" class="slide level2">
<h2>Chatbots</h2>
<p>Similarly, we can see how the approach towards creating “talking programs” (that might pass the Turing test) changed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Early programs of this kind such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA">Eliza</a>, were based on very simple grammatical rules and the re-formulation of the input sentence into a question.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="chatbots-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Chatbots</h2>
<p>Similarly, we can see how the approach towards creating “talking programs” (that might pass the Turing test) changed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modern assistants, such as Cortana, Siri or Google Assistant are all hybrid systems that use Neural networks to convert speech into text and recognize our intent, and then employ some reasoning or explicit algorithms to perform required actions.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="chatbots-2" class="slide level2">
<h2>Chatbots</h2>
<p>Similarly, we can see how the approach towards creating “talking programs” (that might pass the Turing test) changed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Depending on who you ask, this is where we are now.
<ul>
<li>If you ask me, “no”.
<ul>
<li>My job is to know how to answer this question.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you ask Sam Altman, “yes”.
<ul>
<li>Sam Altman’s job is convincingly say “yes” when asked this question.</li>

<section id="more-compute" class="slide level2">
<h2>More compute</h2>
<ul>
<li>A graduate students at UToronto affiliated with Prof.&nbsp;Hinton decided to use a GPU (graphics processing unit) instead of CPU (central processing unit) for <em>image classification</em>.</li>
<li>This is the first <em>documented</em> usage of a graphics-intended compute device for general purpose - or perhaps general AI - usage - of which I am aware.
<ul>
<li>This is not super well-documented and only something I became aware of “through the grapevine”.</li>

<h1>Supervised vs Unsupervised vs Reinforcement Learning</h1>
<p>Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention. The three primary types of ML are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> Learning from labeled data.</li>
<li><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> Discovering patterns in unlabeled data.</li>
<li><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> Learning through interactions with an environment.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="slide level2">

<h3 id="supervised-learning-1">1. Supervised Learning</h3>
<p>The model is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning each input has a corresponding output. * <strong>Labeled Data:</strong> Training data has predefined labels. * <strong>Types of Problems:</strong> Used for classification (e.g., spam detection) and regression (e.g., predicting house prices). * <strong>Algorithms:</strong> Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, Neural Networks.</p>
<h3 id="unsupervised-learning-1">2. Unsupervised Learning</h3>
<p>The model identifies patterns, clusters, or associations independently without predefined labels. * <strong>Unlabeled Data:</strong> No predefined outputs. * <strong>Types of Problems:</strong> Used for clustering (e.g., customer segmentation) and association (e.g., market basket analysis). * <strong>Algorithms:</strong> K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, PCA, Autoencoders.</p>
<h3 id="reinforcement-learning-rl">3. Reinforcement Learning (RL)</h3>
<p>Involves an agent that interacts with an environment, learning through rewards and penalties to maximize long-term success. * <strong>Interaction-Based Learning:</strong> The agent learns by taking actions and receiving feedback. * <strong>No Labeled Data:</strong> Learns from trial and error. * <strong>Algorithms:</strong> Q-learning, SARSA, Deep Q-Networks (DQN).</p>
